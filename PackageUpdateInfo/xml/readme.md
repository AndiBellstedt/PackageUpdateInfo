# XML

This is the folder where project XML files go, notably:

 - Format XML
 - Type Extension XML

External help files should _not_ be placed in this folder!

## Notes on Files and Naming

There should be only one format file and one type extension file per project, as importing them has a notable impact on import times.

 - The Format XML should be named `PackageUpdateInfo.Format.ps1xml`
 - The Type Extension XML should be named `PackageUpdateInfo.Types.ps1xml`
